# Test Authentication System PRD

This is a test PRD for integration testing purposes. It demonstrates the expected structure and content of a PRD generated by `/wiz-prd`.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. User registration with email/password
1. User login with email/password
1. OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
1. Password reset functionality
1. Email verification

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### P0: Correctness

- Proper error handling for all auth endpoints
- Input validation for all forms
- Edge case handling (empty inputs, invalid formats)

#### P1: Regression Prevention

- Unit tests for all auth functions
- Integration tests for auth flows
- CI/CD pipeline with test execution

#### P2: Security

- Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- JWT token security
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- CSRF protection

#### P3: Quality

- Code follows Python style guide (PEP 8)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Maintainable code structure

#### P4: Performance

- Auth endpoint response time < 200ms (P95)
- Support 1000 concurrent auth requests

## Architecture

- **Framework**: FastAPI (as specified in context)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: pytest (as specified in context)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

## Success Criteria

- All functional requirements implemented
- All tests passing
- Security audit passed
- Performance targets met

## Implementation Notes

- Use FastAPI for web framework (from context)
- Use pytest for testing (from context)
- Follow Go patterns if applicable
